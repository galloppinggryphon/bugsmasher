## Main Features

* The bug hops randomly around the game area at a given interval
* The player tries to catch the bug by clicking on it
* If he succeeds, the score is incremented
* The hopping interval is decremented by a number of milliseconds, so it gets harder to catch the bug.
* If the game becomes too challenging, the payer can reset the speed to the initial hopping interval by clicking the Reset Speed button.
* If the player wants, he can start again by resetting the score by clicking the Reset Score button.

## Additional Features

* Easily configurable (ðŸ‘‰settings.json)
* Also counts misses
* The game will end after a certain number of misses (20) or rounds (50)
* The interval between hops decreases as the game progresses, so less progress is won, but the game will also last longer
* Mouse-over grace period: if the mouse hovers over the bug, it will be delayed to ensure there is enough time hit it

## Configuration
